# üëÅÔ∏è Views (`creating_views.sql`)

## What is it?
A **view** is a virtual table that is created from the result of a query. It does not store data itself but displays data from one or more tables.

## Why is it important?
- Views help **simplify complex queries** by encapsulating them in a reusable format.
- They provide **data security** by limiting access to specific rows or columns.

## Real-life Scenario
In a **company payroll system**, you may want to give certain users access to employee names and departments but not their salary information. A view can provide a filtered version of the data, hiding sensitive columns.

## Project: Company Payroll System
In this project, we will implement views to enhance data accessibility and security within the company payroll system. By creating views, we can ensure that users only access the necessary information.

### Example Code
```sql
-- Create a view showing employee names and departments only
CREATE VIEW employee_department_view AS
SELECT employee_name, department
FROM employees;

-- Querying the view
SELECT * FROM employee_department_view;
