# ðŸ”„ Denormalization (`denormalization_example.sql`)

## What is it?
**Denormalization** introduces redundancy into a database to improve query performance, usually by combining related tables into one.

## Why is it important?
- Denormalization can **speed up read operations** for complex queries by reducing the number of joins.
- It is often used in **reporting** and **data warehousing** scenarios where performance is more important than minimizing redundancy.

## Real-life Scenario
In a **reporting system**, it may be beneficial to have a single table that includes both customer and order data to quickly generate reports, instead of performing multiple joins between `customers` and `orders`.

## Project: Reporting System Enhancement
In this project, we will implement denormalization to optimize our reporting system by creating a consolidated table that includes relevant customer and order information for faster report generation.

### Example Code
```sql
-- Example of a denormalized table with both customer and order data
CREATE TABLE customer_orders (
  customer_id INT,
  customer_name VARCHAR(100),
  order_id INT,
  order_date DATE,
  order_total DECIMAL(10, 2)
);
