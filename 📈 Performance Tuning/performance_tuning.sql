-- Description: This script explains some of the most effective performance tuning techniques in MySQL, 
-- with explanations and example code.

-- ====================================
-- ðŸ“˜ Introduction
-- ====================================
-- MySQL Performance Tuning involves optimizing queries, indexes, and the database structure to ensure efficient
-- execution and resource usage. Poorly tuned databases can lead to slow queries, high resource usage, and long
-- response times. By following performance tuning best practices, you can significantly improve MySQL's performance.

-- Key Techniques for Performance Tuning:
-- 1. Query Optimization
-- 2. Index Optimization
-- 3. Configuration Tuning
-- 4. Database Design Optimization
-- 5. Caching Strategies
-- 6. Monitoring and Profiling Tools

-- ====================================
-- Step 1: Query Optimization
-- ====================================
-- One of the most important factors in performance tuning is optimizing the queries. Poorly written queries can 
-- take a long time to execute and place a heavy load on the database.

-- 1. Use `EXPLAIN` to Analyze Queries
-- The `EXPLAIN` statement shows how MySQL executes a query, including which indexes are used and how tables are accessed.

-- Example:
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 1001;

-- Explanation:
-- The `EXPLAIN` statement shows information about how the `orders` table is accessed, which index (if any) is used, 
-- and the overall efficiency of the query. Use this information to identify if there are any issues with the query execution plan.

-- 2. Avoid `SELECT *` - Specify Columns
-- Instead of selecting all columns with `SELECT *`, specify only the columns you need. This reduces the amount of data being fetched.

-- Example:
SELECT order_id, order_date FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 1001;

-- Explanation:
-- Fetching only the required columns reduces the amount of data MySQL needs to process, improving query speed.

-- 3. Use LIMIT for Large Datasets
-- If you're working with a large dataset but only need a subset of the data, use the `LIMIT` clause to fetch a small batch of rows.

-- Example:
SELECT * FROM orders LIMIT 1000;

-- Explanation:
-- The `LIMIT` clause fetches only 1000 rows, reducing the load on the database when you're only interested in a small portion of data.

-- 4. Avoid Functions on Indexed Columns
-- If you apply a function (like `LOWER()`, `UPPER()`, etc.) on an indexed column in a `WHERE` clause, MySQL can't use the index effectively.

-- Example (non-optimal):
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE LOWER(customer_email) = 'john@example.com';

-- Instead, store data in a consistent format (e.g., lowercase) when inserting it into the table, and avoid applying functions during queries.

-- ====================================
-- Step 2: Index Optimization
-- ====================================
-- Proper indexing is crucial for speeding up queries, especially those involving joins, filtering (`WHERE`), and ordering (`ORDER BY`).

-- 1. Use Indexes on Frequently Queried Columns
-- Create indexes on columns that are frequently used in `WHERE`, `JOIN`, and `ORDER BY` clauses.

-- Example:
CREATE INDEX idx_customer_id ON orders (customer_id);

-- Explanation:
-- The index on `customer_id` will improve query performance for any query filtering or joining on the `customer_id` column.

-- 2. Use Composite Indexes for Multi-Column Queries
-- If you frequently query using multiple columns in the `WHERE` clause, a composite index can speed up the query.

-- Example:
CREATE INDEX idx_customer_order ON orders (customer_id, order_date);

-- Explanation:
-- This composite index will improve queries that filter on both `customer_id` and `order_date`.

-- 3. Avoid Redundant Indexes
-- Having too many indexes can slow down `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations, so only create necessary indexes.

-- ====================================
-- Step 3: Configuration Tuning
-- ====================================
-- MySQL configuration settings (in the `my.cnf` file) can have a huge impact on performance. Here are some important settings to tune:

-- 1. Adjust the Buffer Pool Size (`innodb_buffer_pool_size`)
-- The buffer pool is where MySQL stores cached data and indexes. Increasing its size improves performance for large databases.

-- Example (in `my.cnf`):
-- innodb_buffer_pool_size = 2G

-- Explanation:
-- Set the `innodb_buffer_pool_size` to around 60-70% of the available RAM. This allows MySQL to cache more data, reducing disk I/O.

-- 2. Adjust Query Cache Size (`query_cache_size`)
-- Query caching can speed up read queries by caching the result of frequently executed queries.

-- Example (in `my.cnf`):
-- query_cache_size = 128M

-- Explanation:
-- This allocates 128MB to the query cache, speeding up repeated SELECT queries.

-- 3. Adjust Maximum Connections (`max_connections`)
-- The `max_connections` setting controls how many clients can simultaneously connect to the database. Increase this value if you expect high traffic.

-- Example (in `my.cnf`):
-- max_connections = 500

-- ====================================
-- Step 4: Database Design Optimization
-- ====================================
-- Poor database design can negatively affect performance. A normalized database avoids redundant data but can result in complex joins. Sometimes, denormalization (storing redundant data) can improve performance.

-- 1. Normalize to Reduce Redundant Data
-- Proper normalization helps reduce data redundancy and ensures efficient updates.

-- Example:
-- Normalize customer addresses into a separate `addresses` table instead of storing the address in every order record.

-- 2. Use Denormalization for Read-Heavy Systems
-- For read-heavy applications, denormalizing the data can reduce the number of joins needed in queries.

-- Example:
-- Store the `customer_name` directly in the `orders` table to avoid joining the `customers` table in read-heavy queries.

-- ====================================
-- Step 5: Caching Strategies
-- ====================================
-- 1. Use Query Caching for Repeated Queries
-- Query caching stores the results of frequently executed queries. Ensure that query caching is enabled and properly tuned.

-- Example:
-- SET GLOBAL query_cache_size = 128M;
-- SET GLOBAL query_cache_type = 1;

-- Explanation:
-- Query cache stores the results of identical queries, so when the same query is executed, it is retrieved from cache instead of being re-executed.

-- 2. External Caching (e.g., Memcached, Redis)
-- For high-traffic applications, external caching layers (such as Memcached or Redis) can store frequently accessed data in memory, offloading load from the database.

-- ====================================
-- Step 6: Monitoring and Profiling Tools
-- ====================================
-- 1. Use `SHOW PROCESSLIST` to Identify Slow Queries
-- This command shows the active queries and their execution times, helping you identify slow-running queries.

-- Example:
SHOW PROCESSLIST;

-- 2. Use `SHOW STATUS` to Monitor Performance Metrics
-- The `SHOW STATUS` command provides important metrics like the number of queries executed, cache hits, and more.

-- Example:
SHOW GLOBAL STATUS LIKE 'Queries';

-- 3. Use the `slow_query_log`
-- Enable the slow query log to capture queries that take longer than a specified amount of time.

-- Example (in `my.cnf`):
-- slow_query_log = 1
-- long_query_time = 2

-- Explanation:
-- This captures all queries that take longer than 2 seconds to execute, allowing you to identify and optimize slow queries.

-- ====================================
-- ðŸš€ Conclusion
-- ====================================
-- MySQL performance tuning requires a combination of query optimization, proper indexing, and configuration tuning.
-- Use tools like `EXPLAIN`, `SHOW PROCESSLIST`, and the slow query log to monitor and identify bottlenecks.
-- By implementing these techniques, you can significantly improve the performance of your MySQL database.
