# ðŸ“ˆ Indexes

## What is it?
An **index** is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table by providing quick lookups for specific columns.

## Why is it important?
Indexes are crucial because:
- They **speed up query performance**, especially for large datasets.
- Without an index, the database must scan the entire table to find the requested data, which can be slow.

## Real-life Scenario
In a **library system**, when searching for a book by its title, having an index on the `title` column allows the database to retrieve the bookâ€™s information quickly, instead of scanning the entire books table.

### Example Code
sql
-- Creating an index on the title column
CREATE INDEX idx_book_title ON books(title);

-- Query that uses the index
SELECT * FROM books WHERE title = 'SQL Mastery';
